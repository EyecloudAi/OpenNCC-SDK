## Applicable specifications
&emsp; [OpenNCC DK](/zh/DKIntroduction_zh.md), OpenNCC Knight ,OpenNCC Lite, OpenNCC USB

## Operation steps
### Preparatory work
One openncc camera, one USB 3.0 data cable with type-C interface, and one Ubuntu system computer(if your system is Windows,please install usb dirver first,see details in openncc/View/OpenNcc—Win/How to install usb driver.docx);
Connect the data cable to the USB 3.0 interface of the camera and the computer
![Figure-1](/openncc/docimg/zh/GettingStartF1.jpg)  

### Download the latest release package or source code of view
[DownloadLink](/DownloadLink.md)  
If you start with source code，you need to [Compile and run View](/nccview.md),under CDK's QT project.

### Start from run View
#### 1. OpenNCC operation permission   
Enter CDK directory：Tools/deployment，run script “install_NCC_udev_rules.sh”，in the terminal,input:  
`./install_NCC_udev_rules.sh`   
After get permission to mount the OpenNCC,you need to restart the PC.
![Figure-2](/openncc/docimg/zh/GettingStartF2.png)  
#### 2.Unzip the OpenNCC View packet，enter it，open a terminal，and input:  
`./AppRun`，run the software(If can't run,please input:`sudo ./AppRun` try again）  
After OpenNCC View opened，now we could using the View to work with the OpenNCC camera：  
    * Connect the OpenNCC Cam to the usb3.0 of the PC，clik `Get device info` button to get the device's information.If successful the information of the device would displayed on the Log area,If the connection is not 3.0, please rotate the data cable connected to the type-C interface of openncc camera by 180 ° and insert it again.Clik `Get device info` to get the device information. To make sure the log shows:` USB interface is 3.0` ，and if shows not usb3.0,it also could be used as USB2.0.
    * Could choose one of the format from yuv420p/H.264/mjpeg，the default resolution is 1080p.  
    * Click to load model `“1st network model”`：,select a AI model.Currently already supported more than 10 models. If 'None' is selected means no AI model would be running in OpenNCC only streaming out the video.After you download a AI model,could use ROI function to select a area where you want the AI modle to recognize the scene in the region.
    * “Model Score” It is the lowest score of the algorithm recognition, and the algorithm will select the object in the frame only after reaching it;  
    * ”Display Scaler” is the video display window size, you can adjust the display window resolution.  
    * Check `"show state"` to select whether to display the current status information on the screen, including video stream frame rate，algorithm frame rate, resolution and device ID.  
    * Check `"inference accelerate"` to select whether to enable algorithm acceleration. (must be selected before loading algorithm model)  
    * Click `”Start running models”`，load the algorithm model and open the video stream successfully.
Run the video stream, load the face detection algorithm, and then take a real shot:

##### 2.1 Demonstration of secondary model
  * Select `vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106-fp16.blob` from list  `“1st network model”`
  * After selection, the required model can be selected under '2nd network model'. At present, only one secondary model (license plate recognition) is supported in the demonstration. Users can add more.
### Start with the SDK
1. [Download OpenNCC CDK](/DownloadLink.md),And [install dependency package](/nccview.md)。
2. Enter `Samples/How_to/Load a model`
3. `make clean`, `make`
4. `cd ../../bin/`
5. Connect the OpenNCC Cam with PC，and run `./Openncc`
